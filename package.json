Mockup-Design was taken from frontendmentor.io as [2nd level challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5). \r I wanted a simple layout to start practicing my 11ty skills. This is my first time using it so I'll mostly be using its base functionalities like \"includes\", \"layouts\" and \"partials\". I want to make my code less messy and more enjoyable to read! and easier to maintain.",
