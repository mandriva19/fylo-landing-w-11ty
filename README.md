# fylo-landing-w-11ty
This is Fylo landing page made using [11ty SSG](https://www.11ty.dev/). Mockup-Design was taken from frontendmentor.io as [2nd level challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/fylo-landing-page-with-two-column-layout-5ca5ef041e82137ec91a50f5). 
I wanted a simple layout to start practicing my 11ty skills. This is my first time using it so I'll mostly be using its base functionalities like "includes", "layouts" and "partials". I want to make my code less messy and more enjoyable to read! and easier to maintain. 

Would be also doing my best to make it accessibility friendly. 

Let's go
